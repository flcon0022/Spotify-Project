# Spotify-Project
This project presents a dynamic and interactive web-based music player inspired by Spotify's
user interface and functionality. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
provide users with an engaging platform to stream and control audio playback directly in the
browser.

The front-end design incorporates a clean and responsive user interface styled with modern CSS
and powered by the Font Awesome icon library for intuitive media controls. The layout features
a navigation bar, a song list panel, and a persistent audio control section at the bottom of the
screen. The background and styling elements are designed to enhance the visual appeal while
maintaining usability across devices.

At its core, JavaScript is utilized to manage audio playback, including playing, pausing,
navigating between songs, and updating the progress bar in real time. A list of pre-defined songs
with corresponding cover images and metadata is dynamically rendered into the DOM, allowing
users to interact with individual tracks. Event listeners handle user actions such as clicking
play/pause buttons, skipping tracks, and dragging the progress bar to seek within the track. An
animated GIF is used to visually indicate when music is playing.
The project demonstrates core web development principles such as DOM manipulation, event
handling, responsive design, and media API usage. It serves as an educational example of how to
create a functional and aesthetically pleasing music player using fundamental front-end
technologies
